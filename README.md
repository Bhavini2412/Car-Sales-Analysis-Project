Data Model
The data model follows a star schema, with a central fact table containing sales metrics and surrounding dimension tables providing descriptive context. This structure facilitates efficient data retrieval and analysis.

# Visualization on Power BI
The Power BI dashboard provides dynamic and interactive visualizations of key sales trends and performance metrics, including revenue, profit margin, sales volume, and top-selling models.
